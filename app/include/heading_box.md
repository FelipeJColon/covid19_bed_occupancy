<strong>Summary</strong>
<br>

Forecast bed occupancy for COVID-19 patients using recent data on admission and
an exponential growth model. You can choose to model critical or non-critical
care beds using the two separate tabs. Use the panel on the left to input data
and specify model parameters.

England. Note that this work is under peer-review. Find us on <a href=https://github.com/thibautjombart/covid19_bed_occupancy/issues/ target = "_blank">github</a> for questions and requests.
